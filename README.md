# Integrating Diverse Language Models for Conversational Chatbots

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a conversational chatbot by integrating multiple language learning models (LLMs), including Google Generative AI and OpenAI's GPT models. The chatbot utilizes Streamlit for the user interface and custom modules for conversation management, providing seamless interactions across various domains.

## Features
- Integration of multiple leading LLMs for a diverse response generation.
- Conversation Buffer Window Memory to maintain context over interactions.
- Streamlit-based user-friendly interface for easy interaction.
- Dynamic model selection to leverage the strengths of each integrated LLM.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
2. Install the required dependencies:
3. Run the Streamlit app:

## Usage
After launching the Streamlit app, users can start interacting with the chatbot by entering their queries into the chat input. The chatbot will generate responses based on the integrated LLMs, maintaining a coherent and context-aware conversation.
